## Introduction

This is a README file for project 1 of Exploatory Data Analysis course. The project involves reviewing the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" by loading the data and examining how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. 
The results are presented by reconstructing the plots using the base plotting system.
